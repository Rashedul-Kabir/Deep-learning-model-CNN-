Build a CNN model by adding the residual block

Objective

To load an image dataset, preprocess it, train a CNN model using same padding, observe the results, and finally build a CNN model using a simple residual block.

Tasks:
Load an image dataset and split it into training and testing sets.
Preprocess the images by resizing, normalizing, and encoding labels.
Build a CNN model using convolution layers with same padding.
Train the CNN model and monitor accuracy and loss.
Create a simple residual block using one convolutional layer.
Build a CNN model by adding the residual block.
Compare the performance of the normal CNN and residual CNN.
